heading: Tardigrades are resilient. Really, really resilient.
subheading: From the Antarctic to the vacuum of space, Tardigrades are found and thrive in the absolute harshest conditions.

And their ability to survive almost anywhere and anything is an attribute we loved, identified with, and adopted for Tardigrade decentralized storage. Although, we don’t have any nodes in Antarctica or space….yet.
