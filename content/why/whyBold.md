heading: To boldly go where, well, where nothing has gone before.
subheading: Tardigrades are trailblazers, pioneers, colonizers, and explorers. They’re often among the very first multicellular animals to colonize new environments. Because they’re the first life to populate new environments, they attract other invertebrates and predators, basically forming the first food chain. Is it a little on the nose that we view ourselves seen as pioneers? Maybe. But, it’s still a pretty damn cool idea.
