heading: How We’re Changing Cloud Storage
subheading: We believe decentralization is better for the people.  With Tardigrade, we’re giving developers a private, secure storage alternative that’s more performant, durable, secure, and more affordable than centralized cloud storage. And even if we really, really wanted to, it’s impossible for us to see any file stored on Tardigrade – which is why we like to say Tardigrade is “trustless”. Our entire code base is open source, so you can be sure it works exactly how we say it does.
