title: Storj Labs Timeline
heading: 2020 and Beyond
subheading: "As of 2019, Storj Labs has 55 globally distributed employees, with offices in San Francisco, Atlanta, and Salt Lake City and remote employees in 12 other countries. We’re currently going into beta with our decentralized, cloud storage product Tardigrade, and we’re adding more nodes to the Storj network daily. Tardigrade will be production-ready this year."
subheading2: "Tardigrade’s S3 compatible gateway encrypts each file client-side (by default) and then splits each file into pieces before distribution across our network of connected devices. Our decentralized architecture offers improved out-of-the-box security and privacy for our clients. It also enables better performance and reliability compared to centralized/legacy/traditional cloud storage providers."
