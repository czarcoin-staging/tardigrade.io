subheading: "Tardigrade is the world’s first, enterprise-grade decentralized cloud provider. Tardigrade is built on the Storj Network made up of unused hard drive space and bandwidth around the globe. By eliminating a central data center, we’re able to significantly reduce costs and resources, allowing us to pass the savings to our customers."
subheading2: "Tardigrade’s S3-compatible gateway encrypts each file client-side, then splits each file into pieces before being distributed across global network of nodes. Our decentralized architecture offers improved out-of-the-box security and privacy for our clients. It also enables better performance and reliability compared to traditional cloud storage."
